  <h1><b>INTELLIGENT FORECASTING BASED ON LONG-SHORT TERM MEMORY</b></h1>
  <br>
  <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
  <p>The stock market is non-linear, which the output is difficult to predict. Stock market research has become a crucial topic in recent years. In some forecast-based markets, people invest in stocks. To predict the market price of inventory, people look for such methods and tools. It increases your winnings while increasing the risk of your winnings. Forecasting is very important, especially in the highly complex inventory process. Methods such as fundamental analysis and predictive reliability of the technical analysis. Regression analysis is primarily used to make predictions. </p>
  <p>Accurate forecasting of future stock prices can generate significant returns. The hypothesis of the efficient market assumes that currently, available information is reviewed as stock prices, so price movements that are not recently discovered information are unpredictable. Those who hold this view are free to use many methods and techniques to enable them to be informed about prices in the future.</p>
  <p>Because of the underlying structure of the financial sphere and in part due to the combination of known parameters, mostly closing price  and unknown elements, stock prices are believed to be particularly dynamic and subject to rapid adjustments (like pandemic outbreak, etc.) An astute trader would forecast the stock price and purchase or sell a stock before it rises or falls in value. Though it is difficult to replace an experienced trader's expertise, an accurate prediction algorithm can directly result in significant profits for investment firms, suggesting that there is a direct relationship between the quality of the prediction algorithm and the profit made from utilizing it.</p>
